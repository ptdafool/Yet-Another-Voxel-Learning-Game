# Yet-Another-Voxel-Learning-Game
C#/Unity Voxel Learning Game (Minecraft-Like)

Thanks for stopping by and viewing my Voxel Learning Project.

This project has code developed by youtuber b3agz.  Full credit for the original source code goes to him.
His channel is available here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVsTSlfj0qsWEJ-5eMtXsYp03Y9yF1dEn

This has been used as a learning example, so much of the code will be his, and I do not intend to claim that as my own.

Substantial changes to this project will be made as I learn more.
